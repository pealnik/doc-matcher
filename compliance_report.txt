# PDF Compliance Check Report

Pages 1-4: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 2: The required attachment 'Location diagram of hazardous materials' is missing from the structure listed in the Table of Contents.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 specifies the mandatory structure for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials, which includes 'Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials.' This attachment is not explicitly listed in the report's Table of Contents (Pages 2-3).

Pages 5-8: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 7: Section I-2 entries are not ordered sequentially from lower level to upper level locations.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45, I-3 footnote: Each item should be entered in order based on its location, from a lower level to an upper level and from a fore part to an aft part.
      Reasoning: The sequence violates the spatial ordering requirement. For example, items 5 and 6 (A Deck, lower level) are listed after items 1, 2, and 3 (Nav. Bridge Deck/Wing, upper level).
    - Page 8: Section I-2 exhibits inconsistent ordering between the Engine Room deck levels.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45, I-3 footnote: Each item should be entered in order based on its location, from a lower level to an upper level and from a fore part to an aft part.
      Reasoning: Item 15, located on the E/R 3rd Deck (a lower level), appears after Items 10-14, which are located on the E/R 2ND Deck (a higher level). Item 15 should precede all E/R 2ND Deck entries.

Pages 9-12: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 12: Section III-3 (Gases sealed in ship’s machinery and equipment) fails to list the required hazardous material classification (Type of gases) for multiple critical entries.
      Guideline Reference: Page 21, Section III-3: Type of gases (classification in appendix 1)
      Reasoning: The Guideline Page 21 mandates listing the 'Type of gases (classification in appendix 1)' for all entries in Part III-3. The report entries for AC plant (15 kg), Provision refrigeration (5 kg), ECR AC (2 kg), and Bridge AC (2 Kg) are listed under a generic 'Other, if relevant' classification, and the specific material type (e.g., HFC or HCFC) required for classification is missing entirely in the relevant column.
    - Page 11: Section III-1 (Stores) lists refrigerants (R-22 and others) in cylinders but fails to report the approximate quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 21, Section III-2/III-3 structure (Approximate quantity)
      Reasoning: Part III-1 requires reporting the approximate quantity of hazardous items in stores. Item 9 lists 'Refrigerants (R-22 and others) (in cylinders)' but provides a blank value ('-') in the quantity column, indicating missing data for a controlled substance (R-22, an HCFC) known to be present in cylinders.

Pages 13-16: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 14: Essential ship particulars are missing from the Inventory front matter.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Example of the Inventory for existing ships (Particulars section)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 requires the Inventory to clearly list mandatory ship particulars such as Port of registry, Type of vessel, Gross tonnage, Name of shipbuilder, and Date of delivery. These critical identifying details are absent from Report Page 14.
    - Page 13: The classification column for hazardous materials in the Part III table is incomplete.
      Guideline Reference: Page 13: Appendix 1 (Table A)
      Reasoning: Report Page 13 lists equipment (e.g., Fridges, Water Cooler) that typically contain hazardous materials (e.g., Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) listed as A-3 in Guideline Page 13, Appendix 1). The column 'Type of liquids (Classification in Appendix 1)' is mandatory for providing context on the hazard but is left blank for all entries, rendering the table incomplete regarding hazard classification.

Pages 17-20: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 17: The methodology section for handling inaccessible areas fails to explicitly state the use of the mandatory classification designation 'Potentially Containing Hazardous Material' (PCHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 42: 5.3, Page 8: 4.2.8.3
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 42, 5.3 requires that equipment/areas inaccessible for checks be classified as 'potentially containing hazardous material' (PCHM) and that the entry in the 'Result of check' column should be 'PCHM'. The report's methodology (P. 17) only states that recording techniques were used (e.g., document referral) when sampling was impossible, omitting the required procedural classification commitment.
    - Page 19: The documented list of technical documentation reviewed is incomplete, omitting required sources such as results of previous visual/sampling checks and information from sister or similar ships.
      Guideline Reference: Page 31: 2.1.1.12 and 2.1.1.13
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 31 specifies that the necessary information gathering must include 'Information from other inventories and/or sister or similar ships, machinery, equipment, materials and coatings' (2.1.1.12) and 'Results of previous visual/sampling checks and other analysis' (2.1.1.13). These required investigative inputs are omitted from the list of documents reviewed provided on Page 19 of the report.

Pages 21-24: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 22: The report fails to mention or provide checkpoint assessment for 'Anti-fouling systems containing organotin compounds as a biocide,' which is a mandatory Table A material.
      Guideline Reference: Page 13: Table A, No. A-4
      Reasoning: The Guideline Page 13, Table A, No. A-4, lists two separate requirements under Anti-fouling systems: 'Anti-fouling systems containing organotin compounds as a biocide' and 'Anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne.' The report on Page 22 addresses only Cybutryne, omitting the mandatory investigation and documentation regarding organotin compounds (e.g., TBT-free verification), which must be listed in IHM Part I (Guideline Page 31, 2.2.3.1).
    - Page 23: The indicative list of equipment for Mercury and mercury compounds (B-4) sampling omits several key components explicitly listed in the guidelines' indicative list.
      Guideline Reference: Page 36: Indicative list (Mercury and mercury compounds)
      Reasoning: The Guideline Page 36 provides an Indicative list specifying common components for Mercury, including 'manganese cell, pressure sensors, [and] fire detectors.' These components should be included in the checklist development (Guideline Page 36, STEP 2). The report's sampling summary for Mercury on Page 23 neglects to mention these specific, high-priority locations.

Pages 25-28: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 25: The mandatory ship particulars section is incomplete; the Name of shipowner is missing.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Example of the Inventory for existing ships (Particulars section)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 specifies that the particulars section of the Inventory must include the 'Name of shipowner', which is absent from the vessel data provided on Report Page 25.
    - Page 26: The report chunk fails to present the actual Inventory of Hazardous Materials (Part I, II, or III) data using the standardized tabular formats specified in Appendix 2 of the Guidelines, despite the pages being allocated for item listings.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: Standard Format Part I / Page 19: Standard Format Part II / Page 21: Standard Format Part III
      Reasoning: The Guidelines require the IHM to follow the standard formats (Appendix 2) exemplified on Pages 17, 19, and 21, detailing location, material, and quantity in structured tables. Pages 26, 27, and 28, which follow the ship's particulars and bear headings related to inventory items ('List of items,' 'Ship Stores Declared'), contain no such required tabular data or structure.

Pages 29-32: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 30: The report fails to include the required checklist recording the results of the visual/sampling checks and estimated quantities.
      Guideline Reference: Page 42: 5.3 (results recorded in checklist) and 6.1 (results/quantity recorded on checklist)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 42, Section 5.3 and 6.1 mandate that the results of the visual/sampling checks and the estimated quantity of hazardous materials must be recorded on a checklist. The report confirms 82 samples were taken (P. 30, Pt 6) but fails to present the corresponding checklist or results, which are prerequisite documents for developing Part I of the Inventory (Step 5).
    - Page 30: The report fails to list or classify any areas designated as 'Potentially Containing Hazardous Material' (PCHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 42: 5.3 (classification as PCHM) and Page 41 (example list of PCHM areas)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 42, Section 5.3 requires that any equipment, systems, and/or areas of the ship that cannot be accessed for checks must be classified as PCHM. Page 41 provides an example structure for the 'List of equipment, system and/or area classed as PCHM.' This mandatory designation and associated list are absent from the reported pages, which focus on the assessment and sampling phase.

Pages 33-36: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 33: The report pages intended for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) lack the required standardized tabular content detailing materials, location, classification, and quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17, Table 1: Standard Format of the Inventory (Part I) / Page 19, Table 1: Standard Format (Part II)
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify the standard format for the IHM (Parts I, II, and III), requiring detailed tables listing hazardous materials, their application, location, classification, and approximate quantity (e.g., Guideline Page 17, Table I; Guideline Page 19, Table I). Pages 33 through 36 of the report only contain headers and page numbers, failing to present the core data elements of the Inventory.

Pages 37-40: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (3):
    - Page 38: Pages designated for specific ship locations (E/R 2ND DECK, E/R 3RD DECK, E/R BOTTOM FLOOR) lack the required Location Diagram visualization or structured inventory tables/data.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 3; Page 46: Example of location diagram; Page 17: Standard Format (Part I)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 requires 'Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials.' Guideline Page 46 provides an example showing that diagrams are used for location mapping. Pages 38, 39, and 40 indicate specific locations but fail to provide the actual diagrams, inventory data, or structured content (such as Tables I-1 or II defined on Page 17 and Page 19) necessary to map hazardous materials to these areas. The current content only provides headers.
    - Page 39: Pages designated for specific ship locations (E/R 2ND DECK, E/R 3RD DECK, E/R BOTTOM FLOOR) lack the required Location Diagram visualization or structured inventory tables/data.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 3; Page 46: Example of location diagram; Page 17: Standard Format (Part I)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 requires 'Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials.' Guideline Page 46 provides an example showing that diagrams are used for location mapping. Pages 38, 39, and 40 indicate specific locations but fail to provide the actual diagrams, inventory data, or structured content (such as Tables I-1 or II defined on Page 17 and Page 19) necessary to map hazardous materials to these areas. The current content only provides headers.
    - Page 40: Pages designated for specific ship locations (E/R 2ND DECK, E/R 3RD DECK, E/R BOTTOM FLOOR) lack the required Location Diagram visualization or structured inventory tables/data.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 3; Page 46: Example of location diagram; Page 17: Standard Format (Part I)
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 requires 'Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials.' Guideline Page 46 provides an example showing that diagrams are used for location mapping. Pages 38, 39, and 40 indicate specific locations but fail to provide the actual diagrams, inventory data, or structured content (such as Tables I-1 or II defined on Page 17 and Page 19) necessary to map hazardous materials to these areas. The current content only provides headers.

Pages 41-44: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 43: The safety controls for exposure to Hazardous Materials (Hazard 5) do not include specific measures to minimize exposure risk for non-survey personnel (passengers/crew) during sampling activities.
      Guideline Reference: Page 42, Section 5.2: Safety precautions for passengers, crew members and other persons on board
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 42, Section 5.2 mandates that 'Appropriate safety precautions should also be in place for passengers, crew members and other persons on board, to minimize the potential exposure to hazardous materials.' This includes options like posting signs or providing notification. The report's control measures (Page 43, Hazard 5) and risk treatment (Page 44, Hazard 5) focus only on the surveyor's PPE and specialized procedures, neglecting the required general personnel safety measures.

Pages 45-48: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 48: The entries in the I-2 (Equipment & Machinery) section violate the required ordering based on location.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Footnote requirement on ordering location
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 45 requires items to be entered 'in order based on its location, from a lower level to an upper level'. Report Page 48 lists items located on C-Deck (Item 5) and A-deck (Items 6, 7) after items located on the Navigation Bridge Deck/Wing (Items 1, 2, 3, 4). Items on lower decks (A-deck, C-Deck) should precede those on upper decks (Navig. Bridge Deck).
    - Page 46: The report presents the IHM Part I sections (I-1 Paints and I-2 Equipment) using a detailed VSCP log format instead of the standardized, summarized table structure required for the final Inventory.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: I-1 and I-2 standard table format
      Reasoning: The tables on Report Pages 46-48 are titled 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' but utilize VSCP documentation fields ('Sample No', 'Check Procedure', 'Document Analysis Result') that are not part of the standard Part I table structure specified in Guideline Page 45 (I-1 and I-2 sections). Conversely, the tables omit certain required fields for the final Inventory, such as the 'Name of paint' (I-1) or 'Parts where used' (I-2).

Pages 49-52: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 49: The Inventory of Hazardous Material does not follow the required spatial ordering (lower level to upper level) across the report chunk.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: * Each item should be entered in order based on its location, from a lower level to an upper level and from a fore part to an aft part.
      Reasoning: The reported sequence of locations repeatedly jumps between decks, violating the mandatory structural organization requirement specified in the guidelines. For example, entries jump from the highest point listed (Upper Deck, Sl 15) to E/R 2nd Deck (Sl 16), then incorrectly jump from E/R 3rd Deck (Sl 30) down to E/R 2nd Deck (Sl 31-32), and then later jump abruptly from E/R 3rd Deck (Sl 37) down to E/R Bottom Floor (Sl 38).

Pages 53-56: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 54: Hazardous material entries violate the mandatory requirement for sequential ordering based on location from lower level to upper level.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: * Each item should be entered in order based on its location, from a lower level to an upper level and from a fore part to an aft part.
      Reasoning: The report lists items for the Navigation Bridge Deck (Sl 1-6) followed by A Deck (Sl 13-14). Since A Deck is structurally lower than the Navigation Bridge Deck, A Deck entries should precede Navigation Bridge Deck entries to comply with the mandated 'lower level to an upper level' sequence.
    - Page 53: The IHM table structure deviates from the guideline examples by merging the unit specification into the 'Quantity' column.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: IHM Table Structure (Separate columns for Approximate quantity and Unit, e.g., '3.80' and 'kg').
      Reasoning: In entry Sl 45, the 'Quantity' column contains '800 gm'. The guideline example table structure on Page 45 clearly indicates that the numerical value ('Approximate quantity') and the unit (e.g., 'kg') should occupy two separate columns.

Pages 57-60: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 57: The reported 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' does not adhere to the standard tabular format required for the IHM (Part I or Part III), omitting crucial mandatory fields.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: APPENDIX 2 STANDARD FORMAT OF THE INVENTORY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; Page 21: III-2 and III-3 Standard Formats
      Reasoning: The report presents hazardous material data (e.g., Paints, Insulation, Mercury Vapor Lamp, Battery Electrode across pages 57-60) in an unstructured sample listing format (Sample Label, Equipment, Component, Location). This violates the guideline requirements for the IHM structure, which mandate tables detailing 'Materials (classification in appendix 1)', 'Approximate quantity', and 'Remarks', as shown in the examples for structure (I-1, Page 17) and sealed materials (III-2/III-3, Page 21). These essential quantitative and classification data points are entirely missing from this section.

Pages 61-64: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 61: The reported inventory entries (Pages 61-64) are presented as raw sample descriptions and lack the mandatory data fields required for the standardized Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) format.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: Materials (classification in appendix 1) and Approximate quantity; Page 21: Type of liquids/gases (classification in appendix 1) and Approximate quantity
      Reasoning: The guidelines mandate that inventory entries must include the classification of the hazardous material (e.g., TBT, Lead, HCFC) and the Approximate quantity (Page 17, Page 21). Entries like GRE-V003 (Battery Electrode) and GRE-V004 (Liquid) fail to identify the specific hazardous substance or provide any associated quantity, preventing compliance with the required structure and content of Part I and Part III of the Inventory.

Pages 65-68: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 65: The Inventory entries (found on pages 65 through 68) fail to follow the standard tabular format required for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) and critically omit mandatory data fields.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: APPENDIX 2 STANDARD FORMAT OF THE INVENTORY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (I-1 table format); Page 17: Materials, Approximate quantity; Page 45: Example item listing material and quantity (e.g., 50.00 kg)
      Reasoning: The Guidelines require the IHM to be presented in a standard tabular format (as illustrated on Pages 17, 22, and 45). Furthermore, the required fields for hazardous materials contained within structure or equipment must specify the Material classification (e.g., Lead, Asbestos, TBT, HCFC) and the Approximate quantity (kg, units, etc.). The report lists the component (e.g., 'Putty', 'Insulation', 'Battery Electrode') and location but completely omits the identified hazardous material and its quantity, rendering the inventory data incomplete and non-compliant with the required format of Appendix 2.

Pages 69-72: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 69: The report entries detailing physical components (GRE-S020 through GRE-V008 on pages 69-71) are presented as sampling logs and fundamentally lack the required identification of the specific hazardous material found (e.g., Asbestos, Lead), the associated approximate quantity, and the unit, necessary for inclusion in IHM Part I or II.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: required table structure showing Material, Quantity, and unit; Page 21: mandatory columns for Approximate quantity and unit.
      Reasoning: The IHM requires quantitative declaration of hazardous materials in solid components. For example, entries for items like 'Battery Electrode' (Page 71) only list the component name but omit the identified hazardous material (e.g., Lead) and its quantified mass (kg), which is essential as illustrated by the example table on Page 45.
    - Page 72: The entries related to sealed liquids and gases (GRE-V009 and GRE-V010) fail to include the mandatory classification/type of hazardous substance (e.g., Hydraulic oil, HFC), the approximate quantity, and the unit (m³ or kg) required for IHM Part III.
      Guideline Reference: Page 21: Table III-2 and Table III-3 mandatory fields (Type of liquids/gases, Approximate quantity, unit).
      Reasoning: IHM Part III mandates detailed quantification and specific classification for sealed liquids (Table III-2) and gases (Table III-3). The entries for 'Transformer/Oil' and 'Refrigerator Unit/Refrigerant' (Page 72) only list the generic component, omitting the required classification (e.g., PCB type, HFC type) and specific approximated quantity in the specified units (m³ or kg) necessary for compliance with Guideline Page 21.

Pages 73-76: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 73: The inventory data format is incomplete, lacking mandatory fields for Material Classification and Approximate Quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: IHM Part I-1 requirements; Page 21: IHM Part III requirements; Page 45: IHM Part I-2 requirements
      Reasoning: The provided entries (e.g., Sample GRE-V011, GRE-S026) only list equipment, component, and location. They do not specify the classification of the hazardous material (e.g., Asbestos, HFC, TBT, Lead) as required in the 'Materials (classification in appendix 1)' column (Page 17, Page 21, Page 45), nor do they list the mandatory 'Approximate quantity' column required for all IHM components (Parts I-1, I-2, III-2, III-3). This is a fundamental non-conformance with the standard format required for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials.
    - Page 76: Inventory entries concerning paints (GRE-S031, GRE-S032) lack the required material classification, quantity, and name of paint.
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: IHM Part I-1 structure ('Application of paint', 'Name of paint', 'Materials', 'Approximate quantity')
      Reasoning: Entries GRE-S031 and GRE-S032 identify 'Paint' as the component. For IHM Part I-1 (Paints and coating systems), the guidelines require the 'Name of paint', the 'Materials (classification in appendix 1)', and the 'Approximate quantity' (Page 17). None of these mandatory fields are provided in the report chunk.

Pages 77-80: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 77: The entries presented in the 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' sections (Pages 77-80) are unstructured and lack critical mandatory data fields.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Example of the Inventory requiring Hazardous Material type, Approximate Quantity, and Unit.
      Reasoning: The report structure lists Sample Label No, Name of Equipment, Component, and Location. However, it fails to identify the specific type of Hazardous Material present (e.g., Asbestos in gaskets/insulation, per Guideline Page 45, Item 3) and omits the required Approximate Quantity and Unit (kg, m3, etc.). These data points are essential for the compliant presentation of the IHM, whether for Part I (asbestos in gaskets/insulation), Part II (waste oil), or Part III materials (liquids/gases).

Pages 81-84: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 81: The inventory entries (e.g., GRE-S041, GRE-S042, GRE-S047) fail to specify the classification of the hazardous material identified in the component (gasket, insulation, thermometer).
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Table structure requires Material classification (e.g., Asbestos, Lead); Page 28: Requires Materials (classification in appendix 1)
      Reasoning: The provided inventory examples list components like 'Exhaust Gas Pipe Gasket' (Page 81) and 'Bulkhead Insulation' (Page 83) and their location, but the core element—the hazardous substance itself (e.g., Asbestos, PCBs)—is not documented. Guideline Page 45 and Page 28 mandate that the material classification be explicitly listed in the inventory table.
    - Page 81: The inventory entries lack the required field for the approximate quantity and corresponding unit for the hazardous material found in the sampled components.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Requires 'Approximate' quantity and unit (e.g., 50.00 kg); Page 28: Requires 'Approximate quantity'
      Reasoning: All entries across pages 81 through 84 only detail the sample label, equipment, component, and location. The guidelines (Page 45, Page 28) explicitly require the approximation of the total quantity (in kg, m3, etc.) for each identified hazardous item to be included in the Inventory of Hazardous Materials. This data is absent.

Pages 85-88: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 85: Inventory entries uniformly fail to specify the Hazardous Material type identified for the component.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Hazardous Material identification requirement (e.g., 'Asbestos', 'HCFC', 'Lead')
      Reasoning: For entry GRE-V014 (Refrigerator Unit/Refrigerant) and all subsequent gasket entries (GRE-S049 through GRE-S054), the specific regulated substance (e.g., HFC, HCFC, Asbestos, Lead) is omitted. The guidelines require the listing to clearly identify the hazardous material present, as exemplified by the format shown on Page 45 (listing 'Asbestos' or 'HCFC').
    - Page 85: All inventory entries lack the required specification of approximate quantity and unit of the hazardous material.
      Guideline Reference: Page 21: Approximate quantity requirement (e.g., 15.00 m3, 100.00 kg); Page 45: Quantity and unit requirement (e.g., 50.00 kg, 20.00 kg)
      Reasoning: The core purpose of the Inventory is to quantify hazardous materials. Entries across pages 85-88 (e.g., gasket entries, refrigerant entry) only list component and location, but omit the approximate quantity and unit (kg or m3) required for both Part III sealed liquids/gases (Guideline Page 21, Table III-2/III-3) and Part I structural materials (Guideline Page 45 example).

Pages 89-92: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 89: Inventory entries for solid components (e.g., gaskets and insulation) are missing mandatory fields for Material Classification (in appendix 1) and Approximate Quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 28: Materials (classification in appendix 1), Approximate quantity
      Reasoning: The structured IHM examples (Guideline Page 28) require classification of materials (e.g., Asbestos, PCBs, etc.) and the approximate quantity for all listed parts. Entries on Pages 89, 91, and 92, such as 'Pipeline Gasket' and 'Bulkhead Insulation,' only list equipment, component, and location, omitting these essential data points necessary for a complete Inventory of Hazardous Materials.
    - Page 90: The entry concerning sealed liquids (Transformer Oil, GRE-V017) is missing the required Type of liquid classification (No. in appendix 1) and the Approximate quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 21: III-2 – Liquids sealed in ship's machinery and equipment: Type of liquids (classification in appendix 1), Approximate quantity
      Reasoning: For substances sealed in machinery, specifically liquids and gases (Part III), the guidelines mandate documentation of the classification number/type and the approximate quantity (volume/mass) used in the system, as detailed on Guideline Page 21. The entry for 'Component- Oil' on Report Page 90 fails to provide either of these mandatory specifications.

Pages 93-96: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 93: The reported 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' entries (GRE-S063 through GRE-S070) universally lack mandatory data points, specifically the classification of the hazardous material (listed in appendix 1) and the approximate quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 45: Inventory of Hazardous Materials: Part I (I-1 and I-2 tables)
      Reasoning: For Part I of the IHM, sections I-1 (Paints) and I-2 (Equipment) strictly require the listing of 'Materials (classification in appendix 1)' and 'Approximate quantity'. For example, Page 45, entry I-2, requires these fields for items like Main engine packing. This critical data is missing entirely from all entries across report pages 93-96.
    - Page 93: The inventory data is presented in an unstructured list format (Sample Label No, Name of Equipment, Component, Location) rather than the mandatory standardized tabular structure required for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (I-1, I-2, etc.).
      Guideline Reference: Page 17: APPENDIX 2 STANDARD FORMAT OF THE INVENTORY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 17, Appendix 2, defines the required structure for the IHM using specific tables with defined columns (No., Application/Name, Location, Materials classification, Quantity, Remarks). The list format utilized in the report chunk is not compliant with the standard format for documenting the final Inventory.

Pages 97-100: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 99: Spare parts containing hazardous materials (Asbestos Spare Gasket) are incorrectly listed in Part I of the Inventory.
      Guideline Reference: Page 6: 4.1.3 Checking of materials listed in table B
      Reasoning: The entry GRE-S059 identifies 'Spare Gasket' containing Asbestos. Guideline Page 6, Section 4.1.3 mandates that 'Any spare parts containing materials listed in table B are required to be listed in part III of the Inventory.' This item is listed under the Part I preparation section (Step 5, Pages 97-99), violating the required inventory structure.
    - Page 99: Inaccessible areas or elements (Sliding Door insulation) are noted as unsampleable but are not classified using the required terminology.
      Guideline Reference: Page 8: 4.2.8.3 If the equipment, system and/or area of the ship are not accessible for a visual check or sampling check, they should be classified as 'potentially containing hazardous material'
      Reasoning: Entry GRE-V016 has the remark 'No Suitable Access Point for Sampling.' Guideline Page 8, Section 4.2.8.3 requires that any equipment or area that is inaccessible for checks 'should be classified as 'potentially containing hazardous material'.' This necessary classification terminology is omitted from the entry.

Pages 101-104: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 102: The threshold value listed for Anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne (A-6) is incorrect according to the adopted 2023 guidelines.
      Guideline Reference: Page 13: Anti-fouling systems containing cybutryne threshold (1,000 mg/kg).
      Reasoning: The report lists the threshold for A-6 Cybutryne as 200 mg/kg. This contradicts the required threshold of 1,000 mg/kg specified in the 2023 Guidelines for the Development of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (MEPC.379(80), Guideline Page 13).

Pages 105-108: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 106: The report fails to include the required detailed inventory list (III-4) specifying location, quantity, and remarks for Part II and Part III hazardous items.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (Table format includes No., Location, Name of item, Quantity, Remarks).
      Reasoning: The report pages 105 and 106 only list the category names (C-47 through D-3) and their general inventory designation (Part-II or Part-III). The guidelines on Page 22 provide the specific required format for listing Part II/Part III inventory items, which must include details such as 'Location', 'Quantity', and 'Remarks'. This essential structured data, exemplified by the listing of specific items like Refrigerators and Personal computers in the guidelines, is entirely absent from the report chunk.

Pages 109-112: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 109: Pages 109 through 112 are designated as part of the 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' but contain no substantive data, required inventory tables, descriptive text, or location diagrams.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table structure for Part III items (III-4); Page 46: Example of location diagram
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify the required structure for documenting hazardous materials, including item names, locations, quantities (Page 22, Table 1 example), and visual representation (location diagrams, Page 46). The complete absence of any structured inventory information across these consecutive pages (109-112) of the Inventory document constitutes missing required data elements essential for proper documentation of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials.

Pages 113-116: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 113: Report pages 113 through 116, labeled as part of the 'Inventory of Hazardous Material,' are completely devoid of required inventory content, such as tables, lists, quantities, or location data.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (Table 1 structure)
      Reasoning: The 2023 Guidelines mandate the detailed development and documentation of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials, including specific tabular formats listing items, quantities, and locations (e.g., Guideline Page 22). The complete absence of any substantive data or inventory listing across four consecutive pages within the report, despite the surrounding context being the IHM, constitutes a fundamental failure to comply with the requirement to document the inventory.

Pages 117-120: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 117: Pages dedicated to the 'Inventory of Hazardous Material' lack required substantive inventory data, tables, or item listings.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table 1 (example of Part III item listings) and accompanying footnote 17 (location requirements)
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify the detailed information and format required for recording hazardous materials inventory (e.g., item name, quantity, location description as detailed in Page 22). Pages 117 through 120 of the report are designated as part of the Inventory of Hazardous Material but contain only document titles and page numbering, failing to present any of the required structural data or inventory listings necessary for compliance.

Pages 121-124: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 121: Missing mandatory inventory data (IHM Part I, II, and/or III), including required tables, item descriptions, quantities, and location details.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table 1 (Structure) and Page 22: Footnote 17 (Location requirement)
      Reasoning: The Guidelines define the required structure for reporting hazardous materials, exemplified by Table 1 on Guideline Page 22, which requires specific columns (No., Location, Name of item, Quantity). Furthermore, Footnote 17 on Page 22 mandates specific ordering and detailing of locations for Part II and III items. Report Pages 121 through 124 contain only headers and pagination, failing to include any structured inventory data required by the IHM Guidelines.

Pages 125-128: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 125: The report pages 125 through 128 are empty of substantive data, lacking the required inventory tables, item listings, locations, and quantification details necessary for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 20: Table 1 (Part III requirements) and Page 46: Example of location diagram
      Reasoning: The guidelines mandate the inclusion of detailed inventory information, including item names, specific locations, units, quantities, and remarks (as demonstrated by the structure for Part III on Guideline Page 20). Furthermore, location diagrams are referenced (Guideline Page 46). The provided pages 125-128 contain only headers and page counts, failing to provide any of the necessary data or structure required for a compliant IHM document.

Pages 129-132: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 129: Pages 129 through 132, designated under the header 'Inventory of Hazardous Material', are devoid of any required structural data, tables, location descriptions, or item entries.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (General Inventory Requirement)
      Reasoning: The 2023 Guidelines for the Development of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials mandate the documentation of hazardous items in a structured format detailing item names, locations, and quantities (as demonstrated by the example Table 1 on Page 22). The reviewed pages 129-132 contain only headers and page numbers, indicating a failure to present the substantive required inventory data within this section of the report.

Pages 133-136: Compliant.

Pages 137-140: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 137: The report segment (Pages 137-140) lacks the required substantive inventory data, item listings, or structured tables necessary for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 20: Part III Stores, Table 1 structure and content requirements
      Reasoning: The guidelines explicitly require detailed documentation of hazardous materials, including item names, locations, quantities, and remarks, particularly for stores (Part III, as shown on Page 20). The pages reviewed contain only headers and are blank of necessary inventory content, failing to develop the required inventory listing as mandated by the guidelines.

Pages 141-144: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 141: The report chunk (Pages 141-144) fails to document any required inventory data, tables, or descriptive sections necessary for the Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table III-4, listing items, location, and quantity
      Reasoning: The provided pages (141 through 144) contain only headers and page counts but display no substantive content. The IHM requires detailed listing of items including location, name, and quantity, as exemplified by Table 1 (III-4) on Guideline Page 22. The complete absence of this required data renders the report section non-compliant with the guidelines for IHM development.

Pages 145-148: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 148: The appendix numbering and description listed conflicts with the mandatory structure defined in the guidelines.
      Guideline Reference: Page 12: Appendix 3: Example of the development process for part I of the Inventory for new ships
      Reasoning: Report Page 148 identifies 'Appendix – 3' as the 'Laboratory Accreditation Certificate.' However, Guideline Page 12 specifies that Appendix 3 must be the 'Example of the development process for part I of the Inventory for new ships.' This represents an inconsistent application of the required appendix structure and nomenclature.

Pages 149-152: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 149: Missing required data and structure for the Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM). Pages 149 through 152 contain only headers and page numbering, lacking the mandatory item lists, locations, quantities, or diagrams.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (Table 1 structure) and Footnote 17 (Location requirements); Page 46: Example of location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify that the IHM must contain structured data documenting hazardous materials, including item name, quantity, and location description (as illustrated on Page 22). The absence of any inventory content, tables, or required documentation (like lists or location diagrams) within the pages reviewed constitutes a failure to develop and present the required Inventory of Hazardous Material documentation, making the report chunk non-compliant with the fundamental documentation requirements.

Pages 153-156: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 153: The report chunk (Pages 153-156) is missing the required substantive data, tables, or sections detailing the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) content (e.g., listing of materials, locations, and quantities).
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials
      Reasoning: The 2023 Guidelines require the development of a structured Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM), including data formats for specific parts (like the example for Part III items shown on Guideline Page 22, Table 1, requiring Location, Name of item, and Quantity). The provided report pages (153-156) contain only headers/footers and are completely devoid of the mandated inventory data or structured information, failing to fulfill the primary requirement of developing the IHM.

Pages 157-160: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 157: The report pages (157-160) lack the required structured data and listings characteristic of an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table 1 (No., Location, Name of item, Quantity, Remarks)
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify the need for structured tables and listings to document hazardous materials (e.g., the format shown for Part III-4 on Page 22, requiring columns for location, item name, and quantity). Report pages 157 through 160 are blank placeholders containing only headers and pagination, failing to present any required inventory data, tables, or location descriptions necessary for compliance with the IHM development guidelines.

Pages 161-164: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 163: The report chunk, identified as part of the 'Inventory of Hazardous Material,' lacks all substantive content, including required tabular listings of hazardous materials, item quantities, location details, and corresponding location diagrams.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 listing structure (Table 1); Page 46: Example of location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: The guidelines require the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) to contain structured data, detailing items, locations, quantities, and remarks (Guideline Page 22, Table 1 example). Furthermore, the guidelines reference the inclusion of location diagrams (Guideline Page 46). Pages 161 through 164 of the report contain only headers and pagination, resulting in the complete omission of mandatory inventory data elements required by RESOLUTION MEPC.379(80) within the reviewed section.

Pages 165-168: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 165: The report section (Pages 165-168) is missing the required structural content, such as tables listing hazardous materials, their locations, and quantities.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (Table structure)
      Reasoning: The guidelines mandate the compilation of an Inventory of Hazardous Materials detailing items, locations, and quantities, as evidenced by the example table structure provided on Guideline Page 22 (requiring 'No.', 'Location', 'Name of item', 'Quantity', and 'Remarks'). Pages 165 through 168 of the report contain only headers and footers ('Inventory of Hazardous Material' and page numbering) but completely lack the required inventory data and corresponding tables or listings.

Pages 169-172: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 169: The Inventory of Hazardous Material section, spanning pages 169 through 172, is missing the required data structure for item listings, quantities, and location details.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (requiring No., Location, Name of item, Quantity, Remarks)
      Reasoning: The guidelines require the IHM to detail inventory items in a structured manner, including location and quantity, as demonstrated by the example Table 1 on Guideline Page 22. The provided report pages (169-172) only contain headers and page numbering, resulting in a failure to present the necessary inventory data elements.
    - Page 169: Required location descriptions, structured according to level and position, or supporting location diagrams are absent.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22, Footnote 17: The location of a part II or part III item should be entered in order based on its location...; Page 46: Example of location diagram of hazardous materials.
      Reasoning: The core documentation requirements of the IHM involve specific location descriptions (Page 22, Footnote 17) and supporting diagrams (Page 46). Pages 169-172 contain none of these necessary graphical or textual location references.

Pages 173-176: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 173: The report section skips required core IHM attachments and proceeds directly to supplementary appendices (Appendix 4 and 5).
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 1: Inventory of Hazardous Materials; Attachment 2: Assessment of collected information; Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials.
      Reasoning: The guidelines provide an example of the required structure for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials, mandating the inclusion of specific attachments (1, 2, and 3). The report chunk, despite being titled 'Inventory of Hazardous Material', presents Appendices 4 and 5 (certificates) without indicating the presence or location of the mandatory Location Diagram (Attachment 3) or the other primary attachments specified on Page 44. This suggests a failure to adhere to the required structural components of the IHM document.

Pages 177-180: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 177: Pages designated for the Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM) lack the required structured data detailing location, name of item, and quantity.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials (Table 1 structure)
      Reasoning: The report pages 177 through 180 only contain generic headers and pagination ('Inventory of Hazardous Material'). They fail to provide the necessary substantive, structured inventory content (such as item description, location, and quantity) mandated by the guidelines for the development of the IHM, as exemplified by the format requirements shown on Page 22 (Table 1).

Pages 181-184: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 181: The report utilizes a non-standard appendix numbering sequence (starting at Appendix 6) and includes documentation (International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate) that is not required to be part of the finalized Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) attachment structure.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Example of the Inventory for existing ships (Attachments 1, 2, 3 listed)
      Reasoning: The standard format for the IHM document, as exemplified on Guideline Page 44, specifies three required Attachments (Inventory, Assessment of collected information, Location diagram). The report's reference to 'Appendix – 6' (Page 181) and 'Appendix – 7' (Page 183, the International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate, which is not mandatory IHM content) deviates structurally from the prescribed format and numbering requirements for the finalized Inventory document.

Pages 185-188: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 185: The report chunk (Pages 185-188) lacks the required structured inventory data elements necessary for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) report.
      Guideline Reference: Page 22: Table 1 (III-4 – Regular consumable goods potentially containing hazardous materials); Page 46: Example of location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: The Guidelines require the IHM to contain specific structured tables detailing items, locations, and quantities (as shown in the example on Guideline Page 22), and potentially location diagrams (Guideline Page 46). Pages 185 through 188 of the report contain only headers and page counts, demonstrating a complete absence of the required data fields or structure specified for IHM documentation.

Pages 189-192: Partial compliance.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 189: Error during compliance analysis
      Guideline Reference: N/A
      Reasoning: API error: Invalid operation: The `response.text` quick accessor requires the response to contain a valid `Part`, but none were returned. The candidate's [finish_reason](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#finishreason) is 1.

Pages 193-196: Compliant.

Pages 197-200: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 198: The section concerning Material Declaration (MD) is labeled Appendix 9.
      Guideline Reference: Page 12: LIST OF APPENDICES
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify that the 'Form of Material Declaration' (MD) corresponds to Appendix 6 (Page 12, Page 47). The report uses a non-standard numbering (Appendix 9) for this core component, indicating a structural inconsistency with the defined IHM format appendices.
    - Page 199: The section concerning Supplier's Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) is labeled Appendix 10.
      Guideline Reference: Page 12: LIST OF APPENDICES
      Reasoning: The guidelines specify that the 'Form of Supplier's Declaration of Conformity' (SDoC) corresponds to Appendix 7 (Page 12, Page 49). The report uses a non-standard numbering (Appendix 10) for this core component, indicating a structural inconsistency with the defined IHM format appendices.

Pages 201-204: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (1):
    - Page 201: The report segment fails to include the mandatory attachments required for the completion of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials documentation.
      Guideline Reference: Page 44: Attachment 1: Inventory of Hazardous Materials; Attachment 2: Assessment of collected information; Attachment 3: Location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 44 provides the required standard structure for the Inventory of Hazardous Materials document, which mandates the inclusion of Attachment 1 (the Inventory itself), Attachment 2 (Assessment), and Attachment 3 (Location diagram). The reviewed report pages (201-204) consist only of procedural appendices (12 through 15), indicating that the mandatory core IHM attachments are absent from this segment, rendering the document structure incomplete according to the guidelines.

Pages 205-205: Non-compliant.
  Issues found (2):
    - Page 205: The report chunk, labeled 'END OF REPORT,' is missing the required substantive data, lists, and tables detailing the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM).
      Guideline Reference: Page 37: 2023 GUIDELINES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INVENTORY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
      Reasoning: The core purpose of the guidelines (referenced on Pages 37, 39, 43, and 59) is the development and documentation of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials. A report ending abruptly without containing the actual inventory data, quantities, and locations fails to comply with the fundamental requirements set forth in the guidelines.
    - Page 205: Required structural elements, such as location diagrams of hazardous materials, are not evidenced in the report chunk provided.
      Guideline Reference: Page 46: Example of location diagram of hazardous materials
      Reasoning: Guideline Page 46 explicitly references the inclusion of location diagrams as a necessary component of the IHM documentation. The report ends without providing this required structural element.
